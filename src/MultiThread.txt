The main difference between them is that
join() waits for a thread to die,
 while yield() gives up the CPU to other threads of the same priority.

 1. wait() :- If any thread calls the wait() method, it causes the current thread to release the
 lock and wait until another thread invokes the notify() or notifyAII() method for this object,
 or a specified amount of time has elapsed.
 Syntax : public final void wait()throws InterruptedException (waits until object is notified)
 public final void wait(long timeout)throws InterruptedException (waits for the specified amount of time)


 2. notify() : This method is used to wake up a single thread and releases the object lock
 Syntax : public final void notify()


 3. notifyAIl () : This method is used to wake up all threads that are in waiting state.
 Syntax: public final void notifyAlI()


 NOTE : To call wait(), notify() or notifyAlI() method on any object, thread should own the lock
 of that object i.e. the thread should be inside synchronized area
